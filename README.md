# Blackjack Game

A simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. This game allows players to experience the excitement of Blackjack, competing against a computer dealer with classic rules. Test your strategy, try to reach 21, and avoid going bust!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the game using Python in your command line or terminal.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - You start with two cards, and the dealer shows one card.
   - You can choose to "Hit" to draw another card or "Stand" to keep your current hand.
   - The goal is to get as close to 21 without exceeding it.
   - The dealer will reveal its cards after the player stands and will draw cards until reaching 17 or higher.
3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, you win.
